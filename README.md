## Project Process

I was working on Vue before I started this project. But after learning react js is getting popular, I started learning React JS. I think the best way to learn something is to learn by practicing it. Because this facilitates the learning process and increases the rate of retention. That's why I decided to do this project. I went through very difficult processes for my project to be successful and I never gave up. I noticed similar aspects of React vue but of course it was more complex than vue.
The working logic of this project is mainly to display error messages and to simulate the real Facebook interface in terms of design.

## Result and Success :

- Used `react-hook-form`, `react-yup` plugins to show instant error messages on the login and registration page of this project.
- Used pure CSS in the design creation phase.
- Used `redux` and `react-redux` to show the user information on another page on the registration page. Despite these difficulties, I successfully completed my project and learned a lot of information about react in this process.
